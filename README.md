### HDB Resale Price Prediction
#### Building an Automatic Valuation Machine for HDB Flats & Analysing Pricing Factors (Python, HTML, CSS, JavaScript)
[Web App](https://beanshaped.pythonanywhere.com/) | [Rendered Project Notebook](https://beanshaped.github.io/HDB_Resale_Price_Prediction.html)
In this project, I built a *live web application* for predicting userâ€™s HDB resale price using as few data inputs as possible; feel free to try it out using the link above. 

In the linked notebook, I provide full data preparation, data cleaning, analysis, feature engineering and preprocessing. I build *stacked machine learning models*, training meta models on several varied base models to improve final prediction accuracy. Finally, I use *SHAP to explain model features* both globally and locally, including a weighted and aggregated feature importance across all models used.

### Student O-Level Score Prediction (AIAP)
[Rendered Project Notebook](https://beanshaped.github.io/AIAP_students.html)
In this project, I use ML regression techniques to predict which students will struggle in their final exam with the goal being to allow school faculty to focus more resources on these struggling students. I train various models on the data and build a *stacked models* by training meta models on several various base models, then identify the most important features that explain student final exam performance for post hoc analysis.

### Agriculture Temperature Prediction & Plant Classification (AIAP)
[Rendered Project Notebook](https://beanshaped.github.io/aiap19_agriculture.html)
This project involves a sparse dataset with a large amount of missing data, adding more emphasis on data cleaning techniques. After performing EDA, I train models separately for the regression and multi-class classification tasks respectively, and conduct post hoc analysis to identify unusual results.
